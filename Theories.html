    <h1>Theories</h1>
    <p> Like i was saying erlier there are a couple theories about what happens in a black hole. There was the white
        hole theorie that i was talking about earlier but there are a couple otheres such as the theorie that black
        holes produce dark matter. For a liitle back ground dark matter is a theoretical type of matter. Dark matter
        dosnt behave like normal matter. Instead of it having gravity it reppels every thing it can. Dark matter wins
        over normal matter in spaces bigger than galaxys. This is why the univers isnt just a soup of stars. But in
        closer distances normal matter and gravity winn and this is why we have galaxys solar systems and planets. But
        this is what we think happens. Again dark matter is theoretical and hasnt bean detected. It produces no sort of
        light wavlength or radio signals. Sound familiar? This is what lead some scientists to belive that some black
        holes produce dark matter. What you can see below is a visualasation on how the black and whithe holes would
        work. </p>

<p>There are reasons why scientists look for ways to explain black holes. The main one is so that the laws of relativity
    and other laws can still be valid with the existance of black holes. This is because at first sight black holes
    break the biggest law of the universe. Matter cant be created or destroyed. Another way black holes break th elaws
    of physics is with information. Information in its basic form is the way attoms arange thmselves to creat things.
    For example if molocules arange themselves in a way it can become a banana. And if you move around the molocules
    they make a squirl. Another way to think of it is if you burn a peace of paper compleatly and keep al the ashes it
    is theoreticly posible to rearange the attoms and get that paper back. But this is where black holes interfere.
    Information can be what attoms are and what they are made of. If a black hole takes that information away we wouldnt
    know what it can become therfore what could happen. </p>
