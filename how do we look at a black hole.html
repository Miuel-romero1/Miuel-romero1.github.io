    <h1>How to look at a black hole</h1>
    <p>Photographing a black hole isnt as easy as just taking a picture. Black holes soak up all forms of radiation
        inclouding visible light. Therefore black holes dont have a color thats why they are called black holes. But you
        have probably seen that scientist maneged to take a picture of a black hole. This event was also really big
        because before we didnt really know if black holes existed but know we know for a fact that they are real. To
        get the image you see today scientists needed a really big telescope and a lot of presision. In fact we needed a
        telescope the size of the earth. Scientists re aranged observatories around the world and pointed them at a
        certain point in the sky. The blacj hole they photographed was millions of light years away. Below you can see a
        picture of the black hole. The first thing you might ask is "why is it so blurry?" The same reason that if you
        want to take a picture with your phone of something far away. Its very far. Now some people now just say well
        know that we know its possible to take pictures of black holes why dont we just do it all the time? This is
        because this picture had the perfect conditions and it took a lot of effort to do this. </p>
