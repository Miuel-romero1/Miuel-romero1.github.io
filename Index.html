    <p> Black holes are a very interesting. They seem to defy the laws of physiscs. They are sometime called the heart
        of darknes. Black holes are a big mystery to astronomy. People think diferent things when it comes to black
        holes. Like what happens inside and what is on the other side.
        Throught this webpage you will see diferent facts about black holes.
        When it comes to showing or illustraiting black holes its difficult because the gravetational force is so strong
        not light can get out. Or any sort of information such as radio waves or any sort of signal.
        The realy cool thing about black holes is that since we dont know what happens in the middle people make
        theories about what happens. There are theories like the wormhole theorie where black holes dont destroy what
        comes in but it just transports it somwhere else. A white hole. A white hole is a moral oposite to a black hole.
        instead of nothing coming out of the black hole with a white hole nothing can get in. But the thing with white
        holes is that thy are compleatly theoretical and dont have that much proof suporting them. you can see more of
        the theories in the link below. </p>
