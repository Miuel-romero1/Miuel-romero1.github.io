    <h1>How black holes can be formed</h1>
    <p>As we know of right now there is only one real way black holes are created and that is throu starts. When a star
        dies it can go two ways. If the star isnt big enough the star will become a netron star. This is when that star
        colapses and all the stars matter colapses int the size of a country. This means that the star is increadibly
        dense. For a comparison a sugar cube worth of netron star material it would weigh as much as around a burg
        califa. If the star is massive enough when the star implodes it will become a black hole. When this happens the
        star becomes a singularity. A singularity is a infinitly dense point. This means that the gravitational force is
        insane. If you where to fall into a black hole at a point your legs will be 1000 times more atracted to the
        singularity than your head will be. </p>
    <p>But theoreticly there are other ways for black holes to be made. Theoreticly anything can become a black hoel.
        You, a building, mount everest and the cimouter you are reading this on right now. You see evry thing that has
        mass has a schwartz child radius. This is a radius where if the object is compact and dense enough it will
        become a black hole. For example planet Erth has a schwartzchild radious thats as big as a penut. For mount
        everest you would have to shrink it down smaller than a nanometer. Luckly we dont have to worry about a planet
        or a person becoming a black hole because we dont have the means and technology to compress something to this
        degree. </p>
